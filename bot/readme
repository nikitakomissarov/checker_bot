To use the code you have to:
1. Check requirements.txt and be sure that your virtenv includes each from needed modules.
2. Take your own tokens from Telegram and Devman, then insert they into .env like:
DM_TOKEN = '****'
BOT_TOKEN = '****'.
But do not forget to create .env on you local machine first.

Then write something to your bot. After it receive any message from you, it'll be able to retrieve your 'chat_id' and use it in the code automatically.
Cheers.
